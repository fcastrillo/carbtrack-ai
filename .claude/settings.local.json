ARTIFACT LOCATIONS \\(lines 178-203 of ADR-003\\)\nDirectory structure for E3+ epics:\n- work/epics/eN-{name}/scope.md ← /rai-epic-design\n- work/epics/eN-{name}/plan.md ← /rai-epic-plan\n- work/epics/eN-{name}/stories/fN.M-{name}/scope.md ← /rai-story-start\n- work/epics/eN-{name}/stories/fN.M-{name}/design.md ← /rai-story-design\n- work/epics/eN-{name}/stories/fN.M-{name}/plan.md ← /rai-story-plan\n- work/epics/eN-{name}/stories/fN.M-{name}/progress.md ← /rai-story-implement\n- work/epics/eN-{name}/stories/fN.M-{name}/retrospective.md ← /rai-story-review\n- work/epics/eN-{name}/research.md ← /rai-research \\(optional\\)\n- work/epics/eN-{name}/retrospective.md ← /rai-epic-close\n\n### 2. SKILL-TO-ARTIFACT MAPPING \\(from ADR-003 Rationale section\\)\n| Skill | Output | Purpose |\n| /rai-epic-design | scope.md | Features, dependencies, ADRs |\n| /rai-epic-plan | plan.md | Sequencing, milestones, risks |\n| /rai-story-design | design.md | Approach, examples, acceptance |\n| /rai-story-plan | plan.md | Tasks, verification, order |\n| /rai-story-implement | progress.md | Task log, completion gates |\n| /rai-story-review | retrospective.md | Learnings, patterns, improvements |\n| /rai-epic-close | retrospective.md | Epic metrics, retro, merge |\n\n### 3. NAVIGATION QUESTIONS \\(inferred from ADR-003\\)\nQ1: \"Where do I find the feature requirements?\" → design.md \\(approach, examples, acceptance\\)\nQ2: \"What are the architectural decisions?\" → scope.md \\(ADRs section\\)\nQ3: \"What tasks make up this feature?\" → plan.md \\(task breakdown\\)\nQ4: \"What did we learn from this epic?\" → retrospective.md \\(learnings\\)\n\n### 4. KEY CONSTRAINTS \\(from ADR-003\\)\n- specs/ becomes historical archive \\(E1 only, no new content after E0\\)\n- work/epics/eN/ is canonical location for E3+\n- All artifacts use YAML frontmatter + markdown\n- Single pipeline: RaiSE skills handle design AND execution\n- No dual systems \\(spec-kit vs RaiSE\\) — RaiSE subsumes spec-kit\n\n### 5. WHY THIS STRUCTURE \\(from ADR-003 Rationale\\)\n- Single pipeline \\(design → execution in same tree\\)\n- One navigation tree \\(all in work/\\)\n- Consistent structure \\(YAML + markdown\\)\n- Continuous improvement \\(retrospectives feed memory\\)\n- Simplicity \\(RAI-VAL-2: one system, not two\\)\n\n## Outline for work/CONVENTION-design.md\n\n1. Title & Purpose\n2. Artifact Locations \\(directory diagram\\)\n3. Lifecycle Mapping \\(table: phase → skill → artifact\\)\n4. Navigation Guide \\(answers 4 key questions\\)\n5. Why This Structure \\(simplicity, single pipeline\\)\n6. Historical Note \\(specs/ = E1 archive, work/ = E3+ active\\)\n7. References \\(ADR-001, ADR-002, ADR-003\\)\n\nEOF)",
