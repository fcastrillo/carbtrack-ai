# ADR-003: RaiSE-native design for E3+ (spec-kit retired)

> **Status:** Proposed
> **Date:** 2026-02-13
> **Epic:** E0 (Documentation Homologation)
> **Deciders:** Francisco Castrillo, Rai

## Context

During E1, design followed a two-system workflow:
1. **spec-kit** generated design artifacts (`specs/001/`) — spec, tasks, plan, data-model, contracts
2. **RaiSE** handled execution (`work/stories/`) — scope, design, plan, progress, retrospective

This duality worked but introduced navigability friction: design lived in one tree, execution in another, with no formal bridge between them.

RaiSE now includes `/rai-epic-design` and `/rai-story-design` skills capable of generating detailed design artifacts — contracts, data models, research — that spec-kit previously handled.

## Decision

**Starting with E3, all design artifacts are generated by RaiSE skills and live in `work/epics/eN/`.** Detailed artifacts (contracts, data-model, research) are created as files within the epic or story directory alongside scope.md, plan.md, etc.

The `specs/` directory becomes a **historical archive** for E1. No new content is added to it.

**Go-forward structure for an epic:**
```
work/epics/eN-name/
  scope.md          ← /rai-epic-design
  plan.md           ← /rai-epic-plan
  design.md         ← /rai-story-design (if epic-level design needed)
  contracts/        ← detailed API contracts (when applicable)
  data-model.md     ← schema design (when applicable)
  research.md       ← /rai-research output (when applicable)
  retrospective.md  ← /rai-epic-close
```

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Single pipeline: RaiSE handles design AND execution
- One tree to navigate (`work/`) — no jumping between `specs/` and `work/`
- Skills generate artifacts with consistent structure and traceability
- Retrospective patterns feed back into memory for future design improvement

**Negative:**
- `specs/` stops growing — acceptable as historical archive
- Loss of spec-kit's validation checklist format (quickstart.md) — mitigated: can be incorporated into RaiSE story plan as acceptance criteria

**Neutral:**
- spec-kit is not "deprecated" — it served E1 well. It's simply superseded by RaiSE for this project.

## Alternatives Considered

### Maintain spec-kit + RaiSE duality
- **Rejected because:** Duplicates governance. Two systems generating design artifacts means two places to look, two conventions to maintain, two tools to learn. Simplicity (RAI-VAL-2) favors one system.

### Migrate spec-kit into RaiSE as a plugin
- **Rejected because:** Over-engineering. RaiSE skills already cover the same ground. Building a bridge between tools when one tool suffices adds complexity without value.
