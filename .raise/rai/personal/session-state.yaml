  next_actions:
  - 'F0.5: Go-Forward Convention (S) — consume ADR-003 structure, document design
    conventions for E3+'
  - 'F0.6: Initialize Parking Lot (XS) — can run parallel with F0.5 or as closing
    task'
notes: Strong session — M1 and M2 complete in single session. Documentation features
  executing at 2.0x+ velocity (no test/build cycles). ADR-003 go-forward structure
  section will be directly consumed by F0.5. Process improvement (homologation pre-check)
  identified, applied, and persisted as reusable pattern.
