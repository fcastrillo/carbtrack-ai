  - 'M2 milestone: F0.4 (Document ADRs, S), F0.5 (Go-Forward Convention, S), F0.6
    (Initialize Parking Lot, XS)'
  - 'Estimated M2: ~150 min → ~75 min actual with 2.0x velocity'
  - Or continue E0 in next session with fresh context
notes: 'Session demonstrated complete feature lifecycle (design → plan → implement
  → review)

  for M1 milestone. Batch workflow (Option 3) executed successfully: planned F0.2+F0.3

  together, implemented sequentially, batch committed, reviewed together.


  Velocity consistency: 2.0x avg for Simple doc features (F0.1: 2.0x, F0.2: 2.2x,
  F0.3: 1.67x).


  Homologation toolkit complete: Archive (deprecate with links) + Index (navigate
  with bridge)

  + Nomenclature (map legacy → canonical) = framework migration pattern.


  User transitioning from Shu (learning) to Ha (adapting) — executed advanced batch
  workflow

  successfully, applied learnings between features without prompting.
