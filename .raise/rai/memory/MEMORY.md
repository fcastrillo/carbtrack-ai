## RaiSE Framework Process

### Work Lifecycle (Always Follow)

```
EPIC LEVEL:
  /rai-epic-start → /rai-epic-design → /rai-epic-plan → [stories] → /rai-epic-close

STORY LEVEL (per story):
  /rai-story-start → /rai-story-design* → /rai-story-plan → /rai-story-implement → /rai-story-review → /rai-story-close

* *design optional for S/XS stories

SESSION LEVEL:
  /rai-session-start → [work] → /rai-session-close
```

## Available Skills (19 total)

### Session Skills
- `/rai-session-start` — Load memory, analyze progress, propose focused work
- `/rai-session-close` — Capture learnings, update memory, log session

### Epic Skills
- `/rai-epic-start` — Create epic branch from development branch
- `/rai-epic-design` — Design epic scope, stories, architecture
- `/rai-epic-plan` — Sequence stories with milestones and dependencies
- `/rai-epic-close` — Epic retrospective, metrics capture, merge to dev

### Story Skills
- `/rai-story-start` — Create story branch and scope commit
- `/rai-story-design` — Create lean specification for complex stories
- `/rai-story-plan` — Decompose into atomic executable tasks
- `/rai-story-implement` — Execute tasks with TDD and validation gates
- `/rai-story-review` — Extract learnings, identify improvements
- `/rai-story-close` — Verify, merge, cleanup

### Discovery Skills
- `/rai-discover-start` — Initialize codebase discovery
- `/rai-discover-scan` — Extract symbols and synthesize descriptions
- `/rai-discover-validate` — Human review of synthesized descriptions, then export to graph format

### Meta Skills
- `/rai-skill-create` — Create new skills with framework integration

### Other Skills
- `/rai-research` — Epistemologically rigorous research
- `/rai-debug` — Root cause analysis using lean methods
- `/rai-framework-sync` — Sync framework files across locations

### Gate Requirements

| Gate | Required Before |
|------|-----------------|
| **Epic branch exists** | **Epic design** (/rai-epic-start) |
| **Story branch and scope commit** | **Story work** (/rai-story-start) |
| **Plan exists** | **Implementation** (/rai-story-plan) |
| **Retrospective complete** | **Story close** (/rai-story-review) |
| **Epic retrospective complete** | **Epic merge** (/rai-epic-close) |
| Tests pass | Before any commit |
| Type checks pass | Before any commit |
| Linting passes | Before any commit |

## Critical Process Rules

1. **TDD Always** — RED-GREEN-REFACTOR, no exceptions
2. **Commit After Task** — Commit after each completed task, not just story end
3. **Full Skill Cycle** — Use skills even for small stories
4. **Ask Before Subagents** — Get permission before spawning subagents
5. **Delete Branches After Merge** — Clean up merged branches immediately
6. **HITL Default** — Pause after significant work for human review
7. **Direct Communication** — No praise-padding, say what needs saying
8. **Redirect When Dispersing** — Gently redirect tangents to parking lot
9. **Type Everything** — Type annotations on all code
10. **Pydantic Models** — Use Pydantic for all data structures
11. **Simple First** — Simple heuristics over complex solutions

## Branch Model

```
main (stable)
  └── v2 (development)
        └── epic/e{N}/{name}
              └── story/s{N}.{M}/{name}
```

- Stories merge to epic branch
- Epics merge to development branch (v2)
- Development merges to main at release

## Key Patterns (from memory)

- **BASE-011:** Direct communication, no praise-padding. 'Great question!' adds no value. Say what needs saying, then stop.
- **BASE-012:** Redirect when dispersing (with permission). Tangents go to parking lot. Return to stated goal.
- **BASE-013:** Epistemological rigor: triangulate claims (2+ sources), explicit confidence levels, acknowledge contrary evidence. Stand on shoulders of giants.
- **BASE-014:** Honesty over agreement. Push back on bad ideas. Admit uncertainty rather than pretend confidence. Your judgment is the quality gate.
- **BASE-015:** Type annotations on all code. Function parameters, return types, class attributes. Pyright strict mode is the standard.
- **BASE-016:** Pydantic models for all data structures. Not dict, not TypedDict. Validation at boundaries, serialization for free.
- **BASE-017:** Simple heuristics over complex ML. Keyword matching is 98% accurate. Token estimate = words × 1.3. Complexity must earn its place.
- **BASE-018:** Tests alongside implementation, not after. Write the test, watch it fail, make it pass. Catches issues immediately.
- **BASE-019:** Skills + Toolkit over Engines. Users need flexibility (skills as process guides) + determinism (CLI for data operations).
- **BASE-020:** Jidoka: stop on defects. When incoherence, ambiguity, or drift detected — stop, name it, discuss. Don't accumulate errors.
