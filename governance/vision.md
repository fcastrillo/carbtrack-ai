## Identity

### Description

CarbTracker AI was born from a deeply personal need. Its creator has had Type 1 diabetes since age 11, relying on an insulin pump for over 15 years and, for the past year and a half, on a Medtronic continuous glucose sensor that feeds real-time data to the pump every 5 minutes for automatic adjustments around the clock. Despite this advanced setup, one critical step remains entirely manual and imprecise: carbohydrate counting. Every meal still depends on personal estimation, which directly impacts how well insulin doses are calculated. CarbTracker AI aims to close that gap — by leveraging the rich feedback loop of sensor and pump data collected over time, it helps measure and refine carbohydrate intake with greater accuracy, turning weeks of glucose response data into smarter, more personalized carb estimates.

## Outcomes

| **Outcome** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Reduced Manual Corrections** | AI carb estimates require less manual correction week over week, meaning the model is learning from past meal responses and converging toward the user's real-world biology |
| **Predictable Post-Meal Response** | Post-meal glucose spikes become smaller and more predictable, indicating bolus doses are calculated from more accurate carb inputs |
| **Improved Time in Range** | Time in Range (TIR%) improves measurably over weeks and months — the north-star metric that reflects whether better carb counting translates into better overall glucose control |
| **Systematic Learning from Errors** | The audit engine systematically flags meals where the 2-hour post-meal glucose delta exceeded expectations, turning every underestimate into a learning opportunity |
| **Clinical Expansion Readiness** | The tool proves effective enough to share with the user's endocrinologist and specialized T1D care team, enabling distribution through a clinically credible channel |
